# UCI AIM94 DataSet Data Analysis Sample
Diabetes UCI AIM94 Data Analysis
<p>Data Analysis is the most important part of every machine learning task. We would analyze the dataset provided by Michael Kahn, MD, Ph.D., Washington University, St. Louis. This dataset has a blood glucose level and other measurement records of 70 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes. The records were received from two sources, from paper records and automatic records, which represent a time series of measurements.
It is very unhealthy for a patient with diabetes to have high or low blood glucose levels. My aim is to analyze the dataset and to group patients with high and low blood glucose. If a patient consistently has high, low or even both BG(blood glucose), it means that they need more attention.
